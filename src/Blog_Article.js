                  <p>Step One: Choose a quiet place, which is free from all distraction, interruption or disturbance. This may even be inside a bus or in your own room. The idea is to be able to concentrate in any environment that you find is suitable. The ideal is to be able to concentrate in any environment that you find is suitable. The ideal time, however, I have found to be is, early in the morning or before going to bed. The ideal place however, may be anywhere as long as you can concentrate.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p>Step Two: Feel comfortable. Wear loose clothes or else loosen your belt and tie.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p>Step Three: Be comfortable. Keep your spine straight. Loosen your hands. Relax! This eases your body tension and helps your blood circulate efficiently.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p>Step Four: Close your eyes. That way your physical world does not interrupt you and you can concentrate on your mental world. But avoid quenching your eyes. Close them gently. In fact, once you focus on your images, you may find your eyes closing naturally.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p>Step Five: Breathe normally. Let your body roll with the rhythm of your breathing. Listen to that rhythm.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p>Step Six: Now begin the process of visualization. Create the key images of the subject you have chosen. Form the shape. Add color. Build the sound. Sense them! Focus on them. See them as sharply and clearly as you can with your mindâ€™s eye.</p>
